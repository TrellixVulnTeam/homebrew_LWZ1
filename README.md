#Homebrew üç∫ üç∫

##What it is

A website for a fictional home brewing subscription company, offering different boxes, brewing techniques, and more. This website was my final project of my Front End Developer course at General Assembly. I have refactored it a couple of times as I have continued on my developer journey.

##How to use

This is a static website that i intend to extend and build out functionality for in the near future. I used a few plugins that served a purpose for the stage I was at when i first built this, but i feel i could bring those components in natively.

For now it can simply be cloned and opened in your browser.
